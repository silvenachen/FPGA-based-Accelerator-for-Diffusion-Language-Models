# FPGA-based Accelerator for Diffusion Language Models
Welcome to the open-sourced repository for our FPGA-based MDLM (Masked Diffusion Language Model) Accelerator built within the Allo framework!
## Overview
This project focuses on developing an efficient accelerator for **diffusion language models** on FPGAs using the **Allo** framework proposed in. Allo is a
